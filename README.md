        - Brief Story

            Maria is a refugee and works in a cafe. She took online tech courses back home, but has only recently started attending workshops, after 2 years away from her studies. Her go-to social media app is WhatsApp as she can easily (and for free) contact friends and family back home. She currently does not use LinkedIn or Twitter, but has Facebook and an inactive Github account. Maria and her daughter live with their host family in Coventry. She is a sociable person in real life and likes to bake cakes for her friends.

        - Goals

            * Continue web development studies
            * Start freelancing
            * Find a job in tech

        - Frustrations

            * Work leaves her physically and mentally drained. She has no energy for studying or reasearch. Language is a barrier.



## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.
